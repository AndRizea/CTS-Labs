Bachelor Project Title: 
	- Artificial Intelligence based Solution for Mental Health Issues 
	- Rules-based chatbot using sentiment analysis

Description of the problem to be solved:
	- In the beginning, the bot will ask a simple question ("how do you feel?") in order to predict the user's emotion. Based on that, the bot will adapt to a specific scenario. For the positive emotions, it will have a small talk with the user, while for the negative emotion, it will guide the user throughout some exercises in order to make him/her feel better.
	 
Advantages:
	- The entire code is easier to understand
	- There can be added easily other type of scenarios without any modifications
	
Disadvantages:
	- high level of complexity
	- large number of classes involved in the implementation
