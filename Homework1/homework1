Issues:
	1. Code formatting 
		- there are meaningless white spaces
		- in some parts of the code, the lines are not properly aligned
		- useless comments should disappear
	2. Naming conventions
		- some variables and methods are not properly named (example: 'loan_value' should be 'loanValue' according lowerCamelCase principle)
